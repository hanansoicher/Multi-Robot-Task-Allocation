This project implements a dynamic task allocation system for a team of Pololu 3pi+ robots given a set of tasks (Picking up and dropping off objects with deadlines) in a constrained environment, utilizing an SMT-based Multi Robot Task Allocation library (SMrTa) developed by UC Berkeley post-graduate researchers.

Setup:
git clone --recurse-submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
